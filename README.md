# JavaStudies
Here I have my studies in Java to understand its syntax and nuances. I will upload everything related to my studies, since the first line of code and the very last.

# Why am I doing this?
I want to truly learn java since it is a very special programming language. Since I am already familiar with JavaScript and I am also having a lecture on object-oriented programming, I want to track my understanding of the language and logic of it. 

# Which course am I enrolled in?
